# Dicethulhu

Our submission for [GMTK 2022](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022). The theme for the jam was **Role of the dice**.

For this jam we used the [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) game engine which we've never used before. Overall it was a very good experience, personally my new favourite game engine!
